### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [JoÃ£o Victor](https://joao.rs), I'm 21 yo, and I create Software.  
I'm currently working as a Java Freelancer.

I Love Rust and Kotlin.  
I also love working with devops/systems design and tooling, specially game related stuff.

Most of the stuff I do on my free time is related to:
- Listening to music
- Playing games
- Starting projects that I'll never finish
